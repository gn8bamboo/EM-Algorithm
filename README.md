# Expectation Maximization Algorithm in R Shiny Apps

## About
It implements inference of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in R Shiny Apps.

EM algorithm is a machine learning technique that computes the maximum likelihood estimates for multiple parameters depending the userâ€™s input. The algorithm requires some user input to help classify the best estimation based on the number of modes. 
However, the number of modes can be determined mathematically, after the iterations of different number of modes have been done. Overall, the EM algorithm is considered a clustering technique because it categorizes what data points belong to which set parameters by estimating the correct parameters from the data points.
